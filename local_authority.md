title: Local Authority Control in Special Collections and Archives
---

[Authority control is defined](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authority_control) as the process of using single, distinct, _authorized_ forms of the name of a topical or named entity, such as a person, organization, or concept, for the purposes of describing the nature or subject(s) of a resource. "Authorized" in this context means that there is one particular established form of the name, to be used in all records in the cataloging and classification system. Such data is recorded in authority records; an assemblage of many authority records is called an authority file.

Special Collections and Archives uses [ArchivesSpace](https://duarchives.coalliance.org) as its local authority file for subject headings and the names of agents -- that is, people, organizations, and families -- who are creators or subjects of its collections and their constituent materials. Where possible, all subjects and agents established for local use are checked against existing authority files to determine if we can link to an established authority record. If this is not possible, an agent or subject heading may be quickly established by a processing archivist, then further refined and checked against authority files by a metadata technician in Digital Collections Services.

## Establishing Subject Headings

Subject headings are used in ArchivesSpace to indicate what archival resources are about; the forms in which they are expressed; the geographic or temporal coverage of those resources; or the uniform titles of bibliographic resources contained within the archival aggregate being described. In ArchivesSpace, the following subject term types are in use:

* _Topical_ headings (MARC 650) are used to indicate what an archival resource or aggregate is about.
* _Geographic_ headings (MARC 651) indicate the location(s) covered by the content of an archival resource. This coverage may include locations depicted by a photograph, mentioned in an oral history, or measured or analyzed by a research data object.
* _Genre_ headings (MARC 655) are used to indicate the form in which an archival resource is expressed. In cataloging terms, they represent the "is-ness" of a described resource, rather than its "about-ness."
* _Uniform title_ headings (MARC 630) indicate the titles of existing bibliographic resources that are contained within an archival aggregate, or are represented as an archival resource. In the context of Special Collections and Archives, they are used to denote University of Denver publications, whether or not they are established in other serials databases (i.e. with an ISSN) or in the library management system.

When establishing a subject heading against an existing authority file, it is important to note that different subject heading term types reference different authority files. At the University of Denver, the order of operations for referencing authority files in order to establish headings for each term type is as follows:

### Topical Headings

1. [Library of Congress Subject Headings](http://id.loc.gov/authorities/subjects.html)
2. [Society of American Archivists Thesaurus for Use in College and University Archives](http://www2.archivists.org/thesaurus#.VyKG7WbVyhE)
3. Establish locally

### Geographic Headings

1. [Library of Congress Subject Headings](http://id.loc.gov/authorities/subjects.html)
2. [Getty Thesaurus of Geographic Names](http://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/tgn/)
3. [Virtual International Authority File](http://viaf.org)
3. [GeoNames](http://geonames.org)
4. Establish locally

### Genre Headings

1. [Getty Art and Architecture Thesaurus](http://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/aat/)
2. [Library of Congress Genre/Form Terms](http://id.loc.gov/vocabularies/genreForms)
3. Establish locally

Always check the above name authorities databases and enter it exactly as it appears. If the record is inaccurate (dates are incorrect, etc.), contact the Digital Collections Librarian with documentation to support the change. Until it is changed, however, it should be entered in ArchivesSpace exactly as it appears in the referenced subject authority file.

When establishing local headings, following a consistent structure is important to ensure compatibility with outside subject authority practices. As these records could one day be aggregated into national and international authority files, we strive to be good citizens of such projects and ensure that when we contribute to such projects, we can do so with a minimum of up-front data maintenance.

Information about data entry for subject headings in ArchivesSpace may be found [here](archivesspace/subjects).

## Establishing Name Authority Headings

There are three broad sub-categories for name authority headings in archival description:

* A _person_ is an individual creator, source, or subject of the described archival resource or aggregate.
* A _corporate entity_ is an organizational creator, source, or subject of the described archival resource or aggregate. Examples include a university college, department, or organization, an athletic team, or a local business.
* A _family_ is a set of persons bound by blood, marriage, or other contract. Family records are used when the archival resource or aggregate describes an entire family unit, or when the material described was donated by a family unit rather by one or two individuals in particular.

Below is the order of operations for establishing a name authority heading against existing authority files:

1. [Library of Congress Name Authority File](http://id.loc.gov/authorities/names)
2. [Virtual International Authority File](http://viaf.org)
3. [Union List of Artists' Names](https://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/ulan)
4. Establish locally

When establishing a name authority heading locally, enter the name as it appears on the collection material, e.g. on the back of a photograph, in a title page or correspondence salutation, etc. Below is the order of operations for establishing a local form of name:

1. As it commonly presented in chief sources of the agent's works (publications, etc.)
2. As it is appears most frequently in the archival materials being described.
3. As it appears in in relevant reference sources (Social Security Death Index, census records, directories, encyclopedias, commencement programs, government records, etc.)
4. The most recently used form of the agent name you can find

Do not use periods in establishing name headings unless they are after a personâ€™s initials.

When creating name authority records for individuals, do not add prefixes (Mrs., Miss, Mr.) or titles (Dr., Rabbi, etc.) unless the only other identification we have on hand for the individual is their last name or their husband's name (e.g. [Schifman, Frank, Mrs.](https://duarchives.coalliance.org/agents/people/11946)).
