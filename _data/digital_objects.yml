  rules: "Each Digital Object must contain at least one file. This is to ensure we have a complete inventory of files that have been digitized.<br /><br />If a Digital Object is compound (i.e. contains more than one file), use one File Version for each constituent file in the compound object. The <a href=\"https://github.com/duspeccoll/ao_mods\">MODS Export</a> plugin looks for Digital Objects with more than one File Version and exports one <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">&lt;part&gt;</code> element for each. Digital Collections DU uses this metadata to determine when to use Compound Object viewers."
