  required: true
  rules: When you use the <a href="https://github.com/duspeccoll/alma_integrations">Alma Integrations</a> plugin to push a Resource MARC record to Alma, or create a bibliographic record for a Resource manually in the Metadata Editor, Alma will generate a unique MMS ID for that record. To enable the Alma Integrations to successfully connect the ArchivesSpace and Alma representations of a Resource, this field must be populated with the correct MMS ID as soon as it is generated.
