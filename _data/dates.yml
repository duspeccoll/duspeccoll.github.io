This field governs which machine-readable date fields are made available to the user in this sub-form: a 'Single' type will allow only for a 'Begin' field, while the other two options will allow for both 'Begin' and 'End' fields.<br /><br />In addition to its use in future faceted browsing applications in the ArchivesSpace PUI, the MARC exporter uses the 'Begin' and 'End' dates when populating control fields, so it is important to use both the human- and machine-readable date expressions."
