This affects the properties and values that the Related Agents sub-form will present to you.

For example, if a user were working on the authority record for Agent A, and created a Related Agent link to Agent B with the relationship type \"Earlier Form of Related,\" Agent B would automatically have a Related Agent link with the type \"Later Form of Related\" added to its record to link it back to Agent A.</p>"
