- name: "Basic Information: Scope Note"
  description: The range of materials which are to be covered by the subject heading, or the definition of the heading.
  required: false
  rules: "Drawn from existing authority files or provided locally by a Metadata Technician. The Scope Note may be used to provide alternative forms of a given heading, in order to allow those forms to be indexed and used in search results. For example, in the heading for <a href=\"https://duarchstaff.coalliance.org/subjects/2311\">Shehitah</a>, we provide the following scope note:<br/><br/>\"Use for: Schachet, Shechita, Shechitah, Shehita, Shochet, Shohet, Slaughtering and slaughter-housesâ€“Jews\"<br /><br />This allows these terms to be indexed in ArchivesSpace alongside the authorized heading, in spite of the lack of thesaurus functionality in ArchivesSpace. Keyword searches for these alternative transliterations will bring up records to which the 'Shehitah' heading has been linked."
