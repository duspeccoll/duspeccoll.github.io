{% assign content=site.data.notes %}

Notes allow for free-text descriptions of attributes of the collection or object being described that do not fall into any of the other modules in the record. At minimum, each collection record should have an Abstract note added; this provides a description of the collection, its creator, and its contents, and will appear in its MARC record in Sierra. Additional notes at any level may include a biographical/historical note, an arrangement note detailing how the collection is organized, and so on.

There are several types of note in ArchivesSpace; we do not apply all note types to every record. More information about each of the notes we use in ArchivesSpace at the collection level may be found below.

## Writing Biographical and Historical Notes

The biographical/historical note places the materials in context by providing basic information about the materials' creator or author. For individuals, the biographical note may include date and place of birth, full and variant forms of the name, occupations, significant accomplishments, places of residence and work, family members, and date and place of death. The SAA glossary uses "organization" generically to denote a wide range of corporate bodies, such as companies, agencies, and their internal units; legislatures and other governmental bodies; nongovernmental agencies, whether formally structured or a loose affiliation of people, such as the Red Cross or clubs, respectively.

Follow the DACS guidelines for "Administrative/Biographical History" contained in Chapter 10, and include (when known) the following information

For biographical notes about individuals:

* Names
* Dates of birth and death, when known
* Place(s) of residence
* Education
* Principal occupation(s)
* Important activities/memberships/service
* Significant accomplishments, honors, and/or decorations
* Important relationships with persons or organizations
* Other significant information, according to cataloger or archivists' judgment

Consider privacy and agency of the individual being described, if that person is still alive. Only use information about an individual that is already publicly available. Our collections do not necessarily fall into this category.

For organizational histories:

* Name(s)
* Dates of existence
* Purpose
* Predecessors and successors
* Administrative structure
* Main functions or activities
* Geographic location(s)
* Name(s) of chief officers
* Other significant information

Some of this information may also be found in the relevant Agent record. If it is not, you may wish to copy it into its biographical/historical note, as detailed in [the Agent record guidelines](agents.md).

Do not include the following types of information in the Biographical/Historical note. Instead, record where indicated below:

* Record information about the scope and content of materials in a Scope and Content note.
* Record structure or system of arrangement of the material in an Arrangement note.
* Exclude this note when the collecting organization is Special Collections and Archives.

Example Biographical History note:

> Anna Ginsberg was born in 1893 to East European immigrants D'vera and Max Ginsberg, who had settled in New York City in the late 19th century. Anna Ginsberg completed high school in New York and moved to Denver shortly thereafter, in 1910. She lived with her family on Denver's west side, where they were actively involved in the orthodox immigrant Jewish community. In 1912 she married Morris Hayutin, who was the son of Russian Jewish immigrants and the owner of the Western Supply Company (he would later own Public Industrial Bank). Anna and Morris Hayutin had three children: Peryle (1915-2006), Irving, and Arthur.

Example Organizational History note:

> The Iota Chapter of Sigma Kappa Sorority was established at the University of Denver in Denver, Colorado, on February 21, 1908. It was the first Sigma Kappa chapter to be chartered west of the Mississippi River and only the ninth chapter chartered since the founding of the sorority at Colby College in 1874. Students at the University of Denver began attempts to form a chapter in 1906, but lacked sufficient funds. In the winter of 1907-08 the Grand President of Sigma Kappa, Sara B. Mathews, visited Denver and recommended that the charter be granted.

> Financial struggles of the organization and health problems of the members limited the growth of the Chapter in its early years. However, five years after the Chapter was founded, it had gained enough strength to host the 39th Convention of the Sigma Kappa Sorority. The convention was successful, with Iota Chapter offering sorority sisters Western hospitality, fun and community.

> The Chapter was involved in a variety of philanthropic activities. Its primary beneficiary was the Maine Sea Coast Mission, and in later years the Chapter also helped patients with Alzheimer's disease. The Chapter members were involved in many University activities, and strove to maintain high academic standards.

> In the 1930s, the Iota Chapter acquired a house for its members. The Sigma Kappa House at 2258 S. Josephine was constructed in 1932. It was purchased by the University in 1960 and renamed for Mrs. Rollie Bradford, a Sigma Kappa alumna and member of the University of Denver Board of Trustees. The building now houses the Delta Zeta Sorority.

> The Iota Chapter had 35 members in 1966, and encountered financial difficulties. The National Council of Sigma Kappa decided to close the Chapter in October 1967, although they left open the possibility of reinstating the Chapter in the future. It was not until 1988, however, that enough interest was generated to recolonize the Chapter. At that time the University invited Sigma Kappa to reopen their Iota Chapter. But by 1993 the Chapter was again experiencing financial problems, and they graduated their largest class ever. Members began sacrificing class commitments to keep the Chapter open, and it was decided to close the Chapter. On May 14, 1993, the members of Iota Chapter voted to release the National Charter it had received when it reopened five years before.
