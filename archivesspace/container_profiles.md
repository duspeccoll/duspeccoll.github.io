Container Profiles allow the archivist to record information about a specific type of container, which is used by Alma in its Internal Note 2 field to record dimensions about a physical item (used by HC staff in space planning) and by ArchivesSpace to calculate the extent of a collection in linear feet. Examples of common Container Profiles (viewing requires a DU ArchivesSpace account):

* [Standard record boxes](https://duarchstaff.coalliance.org/container_profiles/16)
* Legal document boxes ([full](https://duarchstaff.coalliance.org/container_profiles/1) and [half](https://duarchstaff.coalliance.org/container_profiles/2))
* Letter document boxes ([full](https://duarchstaff.coalliance.org/container_profiles/5) and [half](https://duarchstaff.coalliance.org/container_profiles/6))

When building a custom box to hold one or more items (textiles or material culture items, for example), the custom box should receive its own Container Profile. The naming scheme used for Container Profiles consists of its general type, followed by its dimensions measured to the nearest half-inch, largest to smallestâ€“for example, "Flat box, 17 x 13 x 3 inches."

## Field Guidelines for Container Profiles

## Custom box labels

In some cases you may need to create a "Custom Box," i.e. if a blue-board container needed to be built to house the object you are cataloging, or if it is wrapped in Ethafoam. Our naming scheme for these consists of the label for the type of container being built (see the list below), followed by the dimensions (rounded up to the nearest half inch, largest to smallest).

The list of authorized Custom Labels and their definitions are provided in the table below. This table is not prescriptive, and can be extended if needed to account for new classes of custom container:

* **Custom Box:** Boxes of blue-board built by an End Processor or Processing Archivist, to the specifications of the container contents, not otherwise purchased through Gaylord or another supply vendor.
* **Wrapped Object:** A single object wrapped in Ethafoam and barcoded individually, such as a framed portrait or photograph.
* **Crate:** A custom-built wood crate to house large, heavy, and/or otherwise unwieldy objects.
