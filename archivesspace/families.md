{% assign content=site.data.families %}

In ArchivesSpace, Agents are used to represent people, corporate entities, families, or software application that is either the subject of an archival resource or aggregate, or responsible in some way for the creation or management of that resource or aggregate. The Agents tables allow for rudimentary local name authority control in the ArchivesSpace application. Our general principles for local authority work in Special Collections and Archives may be found [here](../local_authority).
