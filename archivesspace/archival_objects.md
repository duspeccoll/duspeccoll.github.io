{% assign content=site.data.archival_objects %}

In ArchivesSpace, the Archival Object represents any component of an archival collection (or Resource), at any level of arrangement and description within that Resource. While all Archival Objects contain the same set of sub-forms and data properties, the properties to which a user should assign values vary depending on the level of description. Consult the general guidelines for [arrangement](../arrangement) and [description](../description) when completing the Archival Object forms for the collection on which you are working.
